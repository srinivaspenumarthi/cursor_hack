# Paid to Hold the Bag
## Liquidity provision is a high-VIX premium — at the daily horizon and at the opening auction — and that is exactly why it is hard to size

## 1. Summary

Short-term reversal is the return to supplying liquidity. Before looking at any result we hypothesised that this premium is larger when liquidity-provider capital is scarce, proxied by yesterday's VIX, and tested the one mechanism on two instruments, then tried to break our own conclusion. **Module A** (36 years of Kenneth French daily reversal portfolios): the expected reversal return rises with lagged VIX (Newey–West *t* = 2.4); since 2004 the large-cap premium exists *only* in the top VIX quintile (14 bps/day when VIX > 24, ≈ 0 otherwise; 52 bps/day on the 44 such held-out days, nothing on the other 455). The pre-registered rule that *levers* into high VIX fails: the book's volatility rises 3.6× across the same quintiles, so more dollars buy the same Sharpe. **Module B** takes the lesson to the opening auction: fading overnight gaps in S&P 500 names open-to-close earns 18 bps/day gross (*t* = 12, gross Sharpe 3.3), 35 bps/day in the top VIX quintile versus 12 elsewhere. At 5 bps per dollar traded it is a market maker's premium — always-on nets nothing — and the pre-registered rule, *participate* only when VIX<sub>*t*−1</sub> ≥ 20, turns −0.26 Sharpe into +0.12 in-sample and −1.83 into +0.24 on the held-out two years, when the top-VIX state paid 56 bps/day and every other state zero. The premium has decayed (33 bps/day before 2013, 8 after). **Module C** tried to beat VIX with a sharper state variable, the variance risk premium (price of risk) separated from realised variance (quantity of risk), and was **rejected**: the premium loads on realised variance and VRP rules lose to constant exposure in and out of sample. What survives for a non-market-maker is a constant-notional large-cap reversal book (net Sharpe ≈ 0.4, break-even 14 bps, $100M–$500M capacity) and, for a desk with 2.5 bps auction execution, a VIX-gated gap fade (Sharpe ≈ 1). All net of costs; all 80 variants reported.

## 2. Economic hypothesis (written before results)

**Who is on the other side.** Someone who must trade *now*: a fund meeting redemptions, a forced de-leverager, an investor reacting to overnight news with a market-on-open order. They pay, through a temporarily displaced price, for a counterparty; the price then reverts. A reversal book, daily or intraday, is a systematic way of being that counterparty. **Why it should depend on VIX.** Liquidity providers hold inventory risk; when volatility is high their VaR limits bind, margins rise and capital is withdrawn, so the price of immediacy rises (Grossman–Miller 1988; Brunnermeier–Pedersen 2009; Nagel 2012). The edge persists because the capital that would compete it away is what is scarce when the premium is highest; at the open the same logic applies to the overnight gap (Berkman et al. 2012; Lou, Polk & Skouras 2019).

**Pre-registered predictions.** Module A — P1: slope of the daily reversal return on VIX<sub>*t*−1</sub> positive, NW *t* > 2; P2: mean rises across lagged-VIX quintiles; P3: *w<sub>t</sub>* = min(VIX<sub>*t*−1</sub>/20, 3) beats *w* = 1 net; P4: alpha survives FF5 + momentum; P5: neighbouring parameters agree. Module B, written after A's result and before any stock data was downloaded — B1: gross gap-fade spread positive, *t* > 2; B2: slope on VIX<sub>*t*−1</sub> positive; B3: at 5 bps, a VIX ≥ 20 participation rule beats always-on, with positive net mean; B4: both legs earn it (long leg only would suggest survivorship); B5: plateau over thresholds {15, 20, 25} and {quintile, decile}. Module C, written after both — C1: in a joint regression the premium loads on VRP<sub>*t*−1</sub>, not RV<sub>*t*−1</sub>; C2: within realised-variance terciles, Sharpe rises with VRP; C3: a VRP-participation rule beats constant exposure net; C4: VIX-term-structure backwardation beats constant, 2008+. P3, half of B3, and C1–C3 failed; kill criteria were written for each.

## 3. Data and universe

All public, no keys. **A:** Kenneth French Data Library (CRSP-based, point-in-time, through Aug 2026): the daily **ST_Rev** factor (long the bottom 30% on day −20 to −1 return, short the top 30%, **re-formed daily**); the daily 6 size × prior-return portfolios, from which we build the **big-cap reversal leg** BIG Lo − BIG Hi; FF5 + momentum. **B:** daily adjusted open and close for the current S&P 500 constituents (Wikipedia list snapshotted and committed; prices from Yahoo via `yfinance`, cached, not committed). Each stock enters **only from its index-addition date** (326 eligible names/day in-sample, 480 recently); removed names are absent, so the universe has survivorship bias — disclosed, and tested by B4. **All:** FRED CBOE VIX close (and 3-month VIX, from Dec 2007, for Module C), aligned by a strict as-of merge so the position on day *t* sees only closes dated before *t* (unit-tested).

Samples: A 1990-01-02 → 2026-08-31 (8,732 in-sample days); B 2005-01-03 → 2026-08-31 (4,949). **Held out for both: 2024-09-01 → 2026-08-31** (the 2-year cap binds; 500 days), evaluated once per module, each in its own commit after the in-sample commit.

## 4. Methodology

**Module A book and rule.** One unit is $1 long losers / $1 short winners. *w<sub>t</sub>* = min(VIX<sub>*t*−1</sub>/20, 3): 20 is the textbook long-run VIX, so *w* = 1 at VIX 20 and the rule is comparable to constant exposure; 3 is a leverage limit; nothing is fitted. **Costs:** a 20-day formation window implies 12–15% of each side turns over daily; we assume **τ = 14%** one-way, dollars traded = 2*w<sub>t</sub>*τ + 2|Δ*w<sub>t</sub>*|, and cost per dollar **c<sub>t</sub> = c<sub>base</sub> × VIX<sub>*t*−1</sub>/20** (spreads widen with VIX), c<sub>base</sub> = 5 bps large-cap, 10 bps all-cap; flat, ×2 and break-even costs also reported.

**Module B book and rule.** For each stock, gap = Open<sub>*t*</sub>/Close<sub>*t*−1</sub> − 1 minus the cross-sectional median gap; sort into quintiles at the open; $1 long the most-gapped-down quintile, $1 short the most-gapped-up, equal-weighted, **entered at the official open and closed at the official close** — never an overnight position. Rule: on iff VIX<sub>*t*−1</sub> ≥ 20, benchmark always-on. Four dollars are traded per day per $1-per-side, so the toll is 4 × 5 bps × VIX<sub>*t*−1</sub>/20 ≈ 20 bps/day; c<sub>base</sub> ∈ {2.5, 10} and the break-even are reported. Stock-days with |gap| > 20% (spin-off artefacts) are excluded using open information only; without the filter results are identical to 0.1 bps.

**Tests and budget.** Slopes by OLS with Newey–West (10 lags); rule comparisons by a spanning regression of rule on benchmark (HAC *t* on the intercept); A's alpha by FF5 + Mom. Grids: A, normaliser {15, 20, 25} × cap {2, 3, 4} × universe × {linear, regime} = 36, plus 2 post-hoc rules (§5.4) = 38 trials entering the deflated Sharpe (Bailey & López de Prado 2014); B, threshold {off, 15, 20, 25} × {quintile, decile} × c<sub>base</sub> {2.5, 5, 10} = 24; C, realised-variance window {21, 63} × rule {VRP > trailing median, VRP > 0, VIX > VIX3M} × book {big-cap, ST_Rev, gap fade} = 18, on the same books and costs. **80 variants, all reported.**

## 5. Results

### 5.1 Module A: the premium depends on yesterday's VIX (P1 passes, P2 passes in shape; both replicate)

| Mean next-day return, bps | slope / VIX pt | NW *t* | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | **Q5 (VIX > 24)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Big-cap leg, in-sample 1990–2024 | 0.89 | 2.42 | 0.4 | 1.8 | −1.0 | 2.2 | **16.1 ± 9.1** |
| ST_Rev, in-sample | 0.78 | 2.45 | 5.2 | 5.4 | 2.8 | 5.7 | **17.6 ± 7.6** |
| Big-cap leg, **out-of-sample** | 2.94 | 2.50 | – | 6.9 | −4.3 | −13.1 | **52.4 ± 50.7** |
| ST_Rev, **out-of-sample** | 2.83 | 3.10 | – | 3.1 | −1.9 | −8.2 | **47.3 ± 44.3** |
| Big-cap leg, 2004–2024 only | 0.82 | 1.66 | −3.3 | 1.2 | −4.5 | 0.2 | **14.0** |

<p class="cap">± is a 95% CI. 1,746 days per in-sample quintile; edges 13.2 / 16.1 / 19.6 / 24.3; out-of-sample binned on those edges (44 days in Q5; Q1 has one day, omitted). Constant-book net Sharpe 1.02 (big-cap) / 2.25 (ST_Rev) in 1990–2003, −0.02 for both in 2004–2024.</p>

P1 passes and replicates with the same sign and a larger slope (figure in the appendix). P2 is not monotone: flat across quintiles 1–4, then a jump. For large caps the premium is *only* in quintile 5, and the sub-period row shows why: after decimalisation and electronic market making the unconditional premium went to zero, as the hypothesis says it should when liquidity-provider capital becomes abundant; what survives is the part earned when that capital withdraws.


### 5.2 Module A's rule: more dollars, not more Sharpe (P3 fails, P4 passes)

| Net of costs | Constant, IS | **VIX-timed, IS** | Timed, flat costs | Timed, costs ×2 | Constant, **OOS** | Timed, **OOS** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Big-cap: ann. return / vol | 6.4% / 17.2% | 10.9% / 30.3% | 11.5% / 30.3% | 5.6% / 30.3% | 2.7% / 20.5% | 8.0% / 23.8% |
| Big-cap: **net Sharpe** (gross) | **0.37** (0.57) | **0.36** (0.53) | 0.38 | 0.18 | **0.13** (0.29) | **0.34** (0.54) |
| ST_Rev: **net Sharpe** (gross) | **0.82** (1.30) | **0.51** (0.93) | 0.56 | 0.10 | **0.04** (0.45) | **0.21** (0.70) |
| Break-even c<sub>base</sub>, big-cap / ST_Rev | 14.3 / 26.9 bps | 15.3 / 22.4 bps | | | | |

The timed rule lifts big-cap gross return from 9.9% to 16.2% at the same mean exposure, as predicted, but volatility goes from 17% to 30%: the book's own volatility scales with VIX, so sizing linearly in VIX scales risk quadratically. Spanning alpha of timed on constant: +0.24 bps/day (*t* = 0.3) big-cap, **−2.35 bps/day (*t* = −3.0)** ST_Rev, whose calm-state premium the rule discards. P3 fails. P4 passes: FF5 + Mom alpha 5.8%/yr (*t* = 2.1) constant big-cap, 11.1%/yr (*t* = 4.8) ST_Rev; market beta 0.2. The grid is a plateau (0.34–0.39; P5 passes); luck alone would give a best-of-38 Sharpe of 0.24. Out of sample the timed rule beat constant, but with spanning *t* = 1.1 after failing on 35 years we do not count it: the premium arrived on 44 high-VIX days and a rule long VIX happened to be large on them (equity curves in the appendix).

### 5.3 Module B: the opening auction pays the same premium, in the same states (B1, B2, B4, B5 pass; B3 half)

| Q1 − Q5 gap-fade spread, open→close | gross bps/day (NW *t*) | slope per VIX pt (*t*) | VIX Q1 … Q5, bps | net Sharpe @5 bps: always-on / **gated** | spanning *t* | break-even c<sub>base</sub> | @2.5 bps: always / gated | days on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| In-sample 2005–2024 | **17.8** (12.1) | 1.39 (3.8) | 12 · 12 · 11 · 19 · **35 ± 10** | −0.26 / **+0.12** | 2.6 | 4.6 / 5.3 bps | 1.51 / 1.12 | 33% |
| 2005–2012 | 32.6 (12.3) | 1.69 (3.7) | 24 → **59** | 1.84 / 1.19 | | 7.6 / 7.6 | | |
| 2013–2024 | 7.6 (5.6) | 0.26 (0.8) | 5 → 11 | −2.06 / −1.00 | | 2.2 / 2.3 | | |
| **Out-of-sample** 2024-09 → 2026-08 | 6.7 (1.4) | **3.98 (3.3)** | – · 0 · 0 · 4 · **56 ± 43** | −1.83 / **+0.24** | 2.0 | 1.8 / 5.9 | −0.40 / 0.92 | 24% |

<p class="cap">Equal-weighted quintiles on the gap relative to the median gap; $1 per side; cost 4 × c<sub>base</sub> × VIX<sub>t−1</sub>/20 per day. OOS VIX bins use in-sample edges (Q1 empty). Legs, excess over the universe's open→close return: long gap-down +9.2 bps (t = 11.8), short gap-up −8.6 bps (t = −11.2) in-sample; +4.4 / −2.3 out of sample. Decile sort in appendix A2.</p>

Gross, this is a 3-Sharpe machine, and it is the mechanism of §5.1 at a shorter horizon: 35 bps/day in the top VIX quintile against 12 in the rest, both legs symmetric (B4 passes; survivorship is not the story), slope *t* = 3.8. Net, at 5 bps per dollar traded, the ≈20 bps/day toll eats the unconditional premium (always-on −0.26), and the participation rule pays the toll only when the premium exceeds it, lifting Sharpe to +0.12 (spanning *t* = 2.6) — but its net mean is not significantly positive (*t* = 0.5): **at 5 bps this is a market maker's premium.** Two facts matter more. The premium is decaying: 33 bps/day and a 7.6 bps break-even before 2013, 8 bps and 2.2 bps since, as electronic market making in the auctions caught up; a 2.5 bps executor earned Sharpe 1.5 over the full sample and roughly zero since 2013. And the held-out two years are the sharpest state-dependence we have seen anywhere: unconditional gross fell to 6.7 bps, the VIX slope rose to 4 bps per point (*t* = 3.3), the 50 days with VIX<sub>*t*−1</sub> > 24 paid **56 bps/day** and every other state paid zero. Always-on lost 30% net; the gated book made 2.5% with a 9% drawdown, Sharpe 0.9 at 2.5 bps (equity curves in the appendix).

### 5.4 Post-hoc, disclosed: sizing Module A by risk instead (2 extra trials)

Sizing by expected return per unit of variance — *w<sub>t</sub>* ∝ max(E[*r<sub>t</sub>* | VIX<sub>*t*−1</sub>], 0)/σ̂<sub>*t*</sub><sup>2</sup>, with E[*r* | VIX] from an expanding regression on days before *t* and σ̂ the trailing 63-day vol — against a vol-targeted book (Moreira–Muir 2017) and constant exposure on the same days (big-cap, 1995–2024, net Sharpe / max DD / worst month): constant **0.31** / −48% / −17%; vol-targeted **0.01** / −70% / −14%; mean-variance **0.19** / −74% / **−53%**. Vol targeting, the default risk tool, **destroys the strategy**: it de-risks exactly when the premium is paid. The mean-variance rule's −53% month is March 2020: the forecast said "premium high", the rule went to the 3× cap, and reversal kept losing. This is why Module B pre-registered participation rather than leverage, and why Module C asked whether any state variable can select the premium without the volatility.

### 5.5 Module C: is it the price of risk or the quantity of risk? (C1–C3 fail; C4 does not replicate)

<img src="../results/figures/pricing_double_sort.png" class="full">

| Net Sharpe by switching rule | Constant / always-on | VIX rule (A: regime; B: VIX ≥ 20) | VRP > trailing median | VRP > 0 | VIX > VIX3M (2008+) | Constant, 2008+ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Big-cap leg, IS → **OOS** | 0.37 → 0.13 | 0.39 → −0.05 | 0.03 → 0.02 | 0.13 → −0.07 | 0.26 → 0.36 | 0.05 |
| ST_Rev, IS → **OOS** | 0.82 → 0.04 | 0.47 → −0.17 | −0.13 → −0.33 | 0.47 → −0.26 | 0.11 → 0.13 | 0.03 |
| Gap fade, IS → **OOS** | −0.26 → −1.83 | 0.12 → 0.24 | −0.28 → −0.87 | −0.36 → −1.57 | 0.65 → −0.18 | −0.78 |

<p class="cap">C1 in-sample, r<sub>t</sub> on VRP<sub>t−1</sub> and RV<sub>t−1</sub> (21-day): t<sub>VRP</sub> / t<sub>RV</sub> = 0.7 / 1.9 big-cap, 0.4 / 1.9 ST_Rev, 2.8 / 3.1 gap fade. Spanning alpha of the VRP-median rule on constant: t = −2.0 (big-cap), −5.7 (ST_Rev). Backwardation on the gap fade: spanning t = 4.3 in-sample on 10% of days; −0.18 out of sample against 0.24 for VIX ≥ 20.</p>

VIX bundles the *quantity* of risk a liquidity provider must hold (realised variance) with the *price* paid for holding it (the variance risk premium, VIX² − RV). If the premium were a price-of-risk effect, VRP would select the good days without the volatile ones. It does not: the premium loads on realised variance, not VRP; the big-cap Sharpe is a function of the realised-variance row of the double sort (≈1.0 in the top tercile, ≈0 elsewhere), not the VRP column; and every VRP rule loses to constant exposure in-sample and out. The one proxy that helped in-sample — term-structure backwardation, a 10%-of-days stress flag — was 1 of 18 variants, helped big caps only modestly (spanning *t* = 1.3) and failed on the gap fade out of sample. Reading: liquidity-provider capital is constrained by **realised** turbulence (VaR limits and margins are set on realised vol), so the premium arrives with the volatility and no public state variable we found separates them — the strongest support yet for the constant-notional conclusion.

## 6. Risk management

**What the books are.** A: long/short equity, residual market beta 0.2, skew +1.2, excess kurtosis 23 at constant notional (max drawdown −48%, worst month −17%); the timed version has skew +4 and kurtosis 127, a P&L made of a few enormous days (−77% / −34%). B: dollar-neutral, equal-weighted, flat at every close, so no overnight, gap or financing risk; its risk is one session's cross-sectional dispersion (worst day −6.6%, 9 Nov 2020, the vaccine rotation: those gaps were information). **Limits:** gross ≤ 2× capital; per-name ≤ 2% of gross with a mega-cap concentration cap; sector-neutral legs; a futures hedge taking beta to zero. **De-risking rule, set in advance: none that depends on realised vol**, since §5.4–5.5 show the premium *is* the realised-vol state. *Participation* is the risk tool instead: B is off two-thirds of the time and, when on, sized so the pre-registered worst month at 1× (A −17%; B −16%) and drawdown (A −48%; B gated −79%, a slow bleed 2010–2023 while the premium thinned) are survivable — a 5%-per-month risk budget implies 0.3× capital for either. **Tail and regime:** the book loses when the hurried trader knew something (2009, 2020); those are the risks being insured. In quintiles 1–4 the modern premium is zero, so a non-market-maker is paid nothing for the risk it runs there.

## 7. Liquidity and capacity

**A** turns over 70× its capital a year. One-way cost = half-spread + square-root impact, c(K) = 1.5 bps + σ<sub>name</sub>√(participation), ≈ 500 names, value-weighted ADV ≈ $200M, single-name vol 2%/day at VIX 20 (`src/gqh/capacity.py`): $10M → 2.6 bps, Sharpe 0.47; $100M → 4.8 bps, 0.38; $500M → 9.0 bps, 0.21; $1.5B → 14.3 bps, 0.00. Our 5 bps is about $100M; the edge is half gone near $500M. **B** trades only in the two auctions, at one price with no spread to cross; its constraint is the open, which clears only ~1–2% of a name's daily volume. With ~80 names per leg, $25M of book is ~$150k per name, about 5% of a $3M opening auction in a $200M-ADV name; $100M would be ~20%, where impact sets the cost. B is a desk-scale trade — tens of millions, not hundreds; 5 bps is our headline, 2.5 bps an execution desk's number. A market maker who *earns* the half-spread faces a negative first term in both books and the gross Sharpes (0.57 and 3.3) are on offer, which is why both premia belong to market makers.

## 8. Limitations and next steps

(i) The French portfolios are a test instrument, not a product; B's universe is survivorship-biased (removed names missing), though the symmetric legs say the result is not drift. (ii) A's turnover and both cost models are assumed and stressed, not observed. (iii) B assumes execution at the official open from orders placed on pre-market prints; that slippage sits in the cost assumption, and part of the premium may live inside the first minutes. A paper-trading layer (`live/`) now measures this: on 12 replayed high-VIX sessions of 2026, baskets chosen from the 09:27 Nasdaq auction indicative price overlapped the official-open baskets by 74–92%, with a per-day shortfall of −47 to +29 bps. (iv) The top-quintile effect rests on ~1,750 in-sample and 44–50 held-out days: the sign replicated with 2–4× the slope, but the 52–56 bps carry ±45 bps intervals. (v) "VIX > 24" was deliberately *not* turned into a rule; Yahoo data can be revised, so the download is cached and the constituent file frozen. (vi) Module C used the two daily public price-of-risk proxies; dealer-balance-sheet measures are quarterly and untried. **Next:** signed auction imbalance from exchange feeds; a Q5-only book on a sealed window before believing 50 bps; intermediary leverage at the monthly horizon.

**A4. Big-cap leg, net return by year, timed / constant (%).** 1990–99: 6/3, 13/14, 9/13, 3/4, 15/24, 15/25, 18/21, 11/12, 34/17, −5/−3. 2000–09: 34/23, 69/50, 56/28, 16/9, 0/0, −8/−13, −3/−5, −5/−9, 61/31, −19/0. 2010–24: 4/2, 1/−2, −11/−11, 1/2, 2/0, −2/−7, 7/12, −3/−5, −2/−4, 11/13, −22/−5, −7/−12, 0/−3, −15/−12, 2/−4. **Gap fade, net by year, gated / always-on (%):** 2005–09: 0/17, −2/35, 41/106, 142/159, 39/41; 2010–14: 0/7, −23/−32, 1/−1, 0/−6, 3/2; 2015–19: 6/−18, −5/−35, 0/−5, 4/−20, −1/−30; 2020–24: −37/−42, −22/−24, −35/−40, −12/−23, 5/−12.

**A5. Honesty log.** Module A: hypothesis commit 10:54 UTC; in-sample commit 11:11 with OOS locked; OOS evaluated once and committed 11:12. Module B: hypothesis and frozen constituent list committed 11:53:57, before any price download; in-sample committed 12:01:40; OOS evaluated once, committed 12:02:08. Module C: hypothesis committed 18:14:13, before any VRP or term-structure series existed; in-sample committed 18:19:02; OOS evaluated once, committed 18:19:38. The sub-period split of B (2005–2012 / 2013–2024) was decided after seeing the by-year table and is labelled descriptive. One bug fixed after A's first in-sample run: factor betas were in mixed units; alphas and t-stats unaffected. 80 variants in total. The practitioner material we were given (an intraday gap-fade strategy matrix and ML-ops code) contained no price or trade data and was used only to motivate Module B's design.

**A6. Repurchase 8-K cash-secured puts, a separate study.** Hypothesis `bad1aab`, 2026-10-04 00:54 UTC, before any filing or option bar was stored. Universe: the 100 common stocks with the highest 2022 consolidated dollar volume on Massive (letter-only tickers; both GOOG and GOOGL qualify on their own volume). After an 8-K whose text matches "repurchase program" or "repurchase authorization", sell one 5% out-of-the-money cash-secured put at that session's close if the SEC acceptance time is before 15:45 New York, otherwise at the next close. Strike from the prior close. Same issuer, 21 sessions earlier, is the control, dropped if another repurchase entry sits within 10 sessions. Haircut 5% of the option premium each side, because the bars are last-trade closes rather than quotes. Returns in bps of cash collateral. Massive's filings endpoint ignores cik, ticker and date filters, so discovery is the SEC full-text index; prices are Massive, with Databento OPRA daily bars only as a fallback (88 queries on the first pull, no extra bars). Filings and bars are written to TigerData.

In-sample, 2023-01-01 to 2025-12-31, committed `80b867f` before the held-out window was opened. 300 filings, 101 with an entry print, 18 pairs still quoted 21 sessions later (the first monthly expiry is often inside that window, so the 21-session mark is missing and the expiry mark is the one with n = 58). Event minus control at 21 sessions: **−120 bps**, 95% interval −293 to +52, *t* = −1.47. At expiry: −111 bps, n = 58, interval covers zero. One session out: +29 bps, interval covers zero. The pre-registered test fails: the 21-session difference is not positive, and only a third of the horizons have a positive point estimate. The 10% haircut on the same marks is −105 bps (n = 18). The 54-variant grid is in `results/eightk_variant_grid.csv` and was not used to pick the headline. The event-only book, which is not the hypothesis, has a 21-session Sharpe of 0.21; median capacity at 5% of that contract's entry-day volume is about $127,000 of collateral.

Out of sample, run **once**, 2026-01-01 to 2026-08-31, committed `f66c2d9`. 89 filings, 26 with an entry print, **3** pairs at 21 sessions: point estimate +1,043 bps, 95% interval −3,816 to +5,902. The sign flips against the in-sample result, which the hypothesis listed as a failure, and the interval covers zero. Horizons with n of 14 to 17 sit between −44 and +125 bps; every one of those intervals covers zero. A second pass at this window is refused by the program.

One scoring error was caught before the in-sample commit: the first pass averaged all 54 variants into the headline. It was discarded and recomputed from the same cached bars. Nothing here changes Modules A–C, and their out-of-sample files were not recomputed.
